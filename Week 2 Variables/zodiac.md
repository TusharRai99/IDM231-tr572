Aries: Abstract Expressionism
(March 20th -April 19th)
Similar to Pollock’s expressive and fast paced brush strokes, an Aries is passionate and eager — the most energetic of all signs, they emphasize liberation, speed and spontaneity. An Aries’s drive and determination may often come across as selfish and even slightly opportunistic, however, this is only because just like Abstract Expressionist painters, they exercise considerable freedom and like to move at a swift and determined pace.

Taurus: The Aesthetic Movement
(April 20th-May 20th)
Being the most loyal and committed sign of all, the practical, patient and devoted Taurus may also appear as stubborn and possessive. A Taurus feels the need to be surrounded by love and beauty, the same way in which the Aesthetic Movement was committed to the pursuit of beauty and ‘art for art’s sake’, believing that art deserved to be judged on its own terms alone — something which greatly appeals to the Taurus’ exquisite taste.

Gemini: Cubism
(May 21st -June 20th)
In Cubist artwork, objects are analysed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form — instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of angles. Sociable and fun loving, the Gemini represents two different personalities in one and you can never be sure which one you will face; they possess a tendency to suddenly turn serious and restless.

Cancer: Expressionism
(June 21st -July 22nd)
Deeply intuitive, emotional, and sentimental, Cancers may appear as sheltered and even a little cold. They are the most challenging sign to get to know, and yet they are some of the most caring and sensitive; just like Expressionist artists, they each express their emotions in a different way. Expressionist art predominantly attempted to convey strong emotion and meaning, rather than accuracy and reality which can be seen in the works of Egon Schiele, Lucian Freud, Edvard Munch and Modigliani.

Leo: Baroque
(July 23rd- August 22nd)
Baroque art was characterised by great drama, sensuous richness and intensity of colour, it reflected the visions and objectives of the new and wealthy middle class; the bourgeoisie. Similarly dramatic, irresistible and confident, Leos are natural born leaders who are used to being the centre of attention. Perhaps the best example to express a Leo’s exuberant personality, charm and love of being admired is that of the Palace of Versailles in France, with its immense size and lavish design.

Virgo: Constructivism
(August 23rd- September 22nd)
Practical, hardworking and perfectionist, Virgos have the greatest attention to detail of all — but unfortunately, their ability to see things so clearly also makes them extremely critical, of both themselves and others. The sole purpose of Constructivism was to ‘construct’ art, and reject autonomy — the same way in which a Virgo feels the need to ‘construct’ all elements of their professional and personal lives. They are able to stay on top thanks to how much thought and planning goes into their day-to-day lives.

Libra: Avant Garde and Counterculture of the 1960’s
(September 23rd- October 22nd)
Considered the calmest of all signs, the gracious, peaceful and diplomatic Libra likes harmony, symmetry and balance in their life. This being said, Libras also severely dislike confrontation, injustice or discomfort of any kind. The Avant Garde and Counterculture Art Movement’s primary purpose was to protest injustice and issues of violence by spreading peace and love, with performance art, festival culture, rock ’n’ roll, psychedelic art and the hippie movement emerging in the 60’s.

Scorpio: Romanticism
(October 23rd- November 21st)
Romantic art had an emphasis on intense emotion and frequently charted the darker, chaotic sides of human existence — it is an art that is both cynical yet amorous at the same time. Similarly, the dark, brooding and often misunderstood Scorpio can appear suspicious, cold and unapproachable, but in reality they are the sign driven most by intense emotion. The Scorpio manifests their emotions differently to others, and they are selective of whom they share these emotions with.

Sagittarius: Futurism
(November 22nd- December 21st)
Like other fire signs, the idealistic, curious, free and open minded Sagittarius needs to be constantly in touch with the world and feels a desire to experience as much as possible. The Futuristic Art movement celebrated advanced technology and urban modernity, the artists wished to demonstrate the beauty of modern life, speed and change — the same way in which the progressive and adventurous Sagittarius does.

Capricorn: Realism
(December 22nd- January 19th)
Traditional and family oriented by nature, the Capricorn represents responsibility and discipline. Realism as an art movement stresses the naturalistic representation of objects and searches for beauty within the genuine and authentic — the same way in which a Capricorn’s self control and ability to stay grounded enables them to progress within both their personal and professional lives.

Aquarius: Dada
(January 20th- February 18th)
Dada had only one rule: never follow any known rules. Considered to be the most humanitarian and progressive of signs, Aquarians do what they believe is right (and do as they please), not only do they not need anybody’s approval or validation, but they don’t care for it. Similarly, the Dada movement celebrated random chance and scorned bourgeois conventions of high culture and classicism. Eccentric, energetic and quirky, the best way to describe the nature of an Aquarius is by comparison to Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 ‘Fountain’.

Pisces: Magic Realism
(February 19th- March 20th)
Deeply compassionate, gentle and emotionally intuitive, Pisces are some of the loneliest signs of all. Perceived as naive due to their capacity to love unconditionally, sensitivity and overly trusting nature, they often isolate themselves by stepping into a dream-like state. Here they can stay long enough to lose all sense of reality, the same way in which Magic Realism adds elements of the mythical and supernatural to the real world or mundane settings. This aptitude for escapism makes Pisces the most imaginative of all signs.
